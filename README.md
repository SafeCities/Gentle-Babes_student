Team 1's Project

JuanaSafe is an app build for women's safety and awareness. It has different sections that can help women avoid danger and harassment specially in public places. It lets the user report and be sent to the Barangay's Women's Desk and this will be displayed in the map. JuanaSafe also has features of awareness where it will show the highlight statistics of the place you are in. Our aim here is to make people aware of the potential danger, so they can be better prepared and make the choices that are right for them.
